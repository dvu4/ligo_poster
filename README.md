### 1. Abstract
Extracting meaningful signals of GW150914 event, an astrophysical event observed by the gravitational-wave detectors from the LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston observatories is a huge effort, and there is a need to reproduce the LIGO collaboration on these quantative results.

Query language for data provenance, Prolog, is useful in computing provenance or lineage, then use this to derive and answer some useful information about the data;


### 2. Purpose
Query data provenance on LIGO script which is exploring signal processing with LIGO GW150914 open data.

Some ([tutorials](https://losc.ligo.org/tutorials/ "GW150914_tutorial_uri.py")) of GW150914 event.

Run LIGO ([code](https://github.com/minrk/ligo-binder "GW150914_tutorial_uri.py")) on binder.
