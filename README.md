### 1. Abstract
Extracting meaningful signals of GW150914 event, an astrophysical event observed by the gravitational-wave detectors from the LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston observatories is a huge effort, and there is a need to reproduce the LIGO collaboration on these quantative results.

Query language for data provenance, Prolog, is useful in computing provenance or lineage, then use this to derive and answer some useful information about the data;


### 2. Purpose
Query data provenance on LIGO script which is exploring signal processing with LIGO GW150914 open data.

Some ([tutorials](https://losc.ligo.org/tutorials/ "GW150914_tutorial_uri.py")) of GW150914 event.

Run LIGO ([code](https://github.com/minrk/ligo-binder "GW150914_tutorial_uri.py")) on binder.

### 3. Graph Query

Q1-pro : Render everything upstream of a given data product D‚Äù, where D can be any one (output or intermediate) data element of the YW model of the script:



Q2-pro : "List the script inputs that are upstream of a given data product D".


I have an error when running the query:


  Users/ducvu/xsb-3.6/config/i386-apple-darwin15.6.0/bin/xsb:
       file doesn't exist or is not executable

  XSB might not have have been compiled for the following machine configuration:
              i386-apple-darwin15.6.0
  ***This installation seems to have the following configurations available: i386-apple-darwin15.5.0
  ***configuration list end

  One other frequent problem: you might be over your disk quota, and your XSB executable might have been deleted by the system immediately after it was created.

  Please contact your system administrator, if you can't rebuild XSB.
